            <p class="project-paragraph">After getting all the urls, the selenium driver will close itself and all of the job lists will be scraped one by one using requests package.<br>For each job url, the job description content will be extracted from page source.<br>Tech skills are predefined in a dictionary. For some skills, some aliases are also taken into consideration(example: css and css3 will map to same key value in the dictionary)<br>Each skill is searched inside of the job description one by one and if found the count is incremented by one.<br>At the end, we have a dictionary of skills and count of job postings that corresponding skill is mentioned for every skills.</p>
